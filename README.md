# My Local Config
My current job mandates working on Windows. 
So I currently live almost exclusively in WSL Ubuntu. With Neovim,
phpactor, git access and docker config stuff, the only thing I've
actually installed on my work computer is WSL. Alongside a browser
and chat software I'm totally good to go. This is the config for
how I'm currently working.

## Things to do in Windows (Assuming WSL like I currently use)
- Install a NerdFont for icons. I most commonly use JetBrains or FiraCode
    - https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads
- Install WindowsTerminal, WSL, Ubuntu, all that jazz.
- Remove margins on Windows Terminal; by default there is a lot of space.
